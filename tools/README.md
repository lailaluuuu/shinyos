# Tools

This folder contains **standalone tools** for authoring and maintenance. They are not part of the main ShinyOS app runtime.

- **lesson-template-maker.html** — Tool for creating and editing lesson templates (e.g. for pasting into `app.js`). Open in a browser; use locally only.

Keep app code in the repo root; keep authoring/helper tools here.
